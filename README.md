## A simple bookmarklet generator ðŸ¤–

Bookmarklets are great for micro to macro automation. Extend what you can do in your browser any way you see fit.

- [x] All code is ready to go as a bookmarklet, so just write some Javascript and have fun

- [x] Eslint in the browser

- [x] Javascript intellisense

- [x] Automatic minification and uglification

- [x] Works great on all devices

# Working together

Just a heads up if you are going to run this site locally you will need to generate a local SSL.

# In the future

I do plan on making a curated list of bookmarklets at some point. I hope some of you will want share some sweet bookmarklets. Bookmarklets I have on the site now are mostly just examples to get people interested. This new page would have a range of small to large bookmarklets. The image I have in my head as far as what this page will do is display cards (title, descriptions, tags, author links). The goal would be at some point to have enough to necessitate a search bar and lots of lazy loading ðŸ’¥
